      One of my all-time favorite comfort foods is fried rice. Whenever I make white rice, I make extra, just so I can have the leftovers for fried rice. Plain cooked rice is tasty enough, but when it's fried the grains get all crispy and seared.
      Mix in some soy sauce, bacon, and some veggies, and oh man it somehow becomes this whole other thing. It's a meal all by itself, that is satisfying on some bone-deep level.
      For this recipe, I wanted to re-create that Chinese takeout fried rice experience for when you're cooking at home. It's a simple recipe, but it has a few tricks that are worth keeping in mind.
